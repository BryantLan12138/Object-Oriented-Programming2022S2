# About this course **COMP 1102**

This course introduces object-oriented programming to students with a background in the procedural paradigm. The course begins with a brief review of statements, flow control and data types, emphasising pointers, array processing and structured data types. It then introduces the object-oriented programming paradigm, focusing on encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction, with a gentle introduction to object-oriented analysis and design fundamentals. Other topics include building 2D games using object-oriented programming, an overview of programming language principles and memory management[^1].

1. Explain the steps in creating an executable program for a computer, including the intermediate representations and their purpose.
2. Manipulate binary patterns and understand the use of binary to represent numbers.
3. Apply good programming style and understand the impact of style on developing and maintaining programs.
4. Effectively use a version control system and the Linux command-line tools for incremental development.
5. Explain the benefits of object-oriented design and understand when it is an appropriate methodology to use.
6. Design object-oriented solutions for small systems involving multiple objects.
7. Implement, test and debug solutions in C++.
